Expander will stop functioning until Secure Input is disabled. and show such errors as:Loginwindow has disabled Text. Expander expansion. Process xxxxx has disabled Text. Expander expansion. How to Fix It. Unfortunately, there are a few situations where Secure Input is left in its “enabled” state when it should not be—when you have finished entering sensitive information, or when you have begun to use a different application than the one that turned on Secure Input. In these cases, you will not be able to use Text. Expander until Secure Input is disabled. So how can you disable Secure Input?Text. Expander will let you know when Secure Input is enabled by updating its menu bar item to indicate that expansion is disabled. If the application enabling Secure Input is not the current application, Text. Expander adds a “caution” symbol to its menu bar icon and Dock icon. (Text. Expander checks Secure Input status about every 15 seconds, so the icon display may lag a bit behind the actual state.) While the menu icon displays as disabled, the “Secure Input enabled by (app name) / Secure Input Prevents Expansion…” menu item indicates which application appears to have enabled Secure Input. Quitting that application will disable Secure Input, allowing Text. Expander to function again.Work-around. In some cases you can avoid Secure Input remaining enabled if you turn off any auto-submit feature of an auto-login that you are using. Instead, once you fill the password field, or your auto-login fills the password field, click whatever “Login” or “Submit” button is provided along with the password rather than pressing the Return key on your keyboard.",https://confluence.gustocorp.com/display/GGKB/TextExpander+Troubleshooting

Create Google Groups (currently limited to gusto.com groups)Add you and your teammates to Google Groups (currently limited to gusto.com groups)Looking up information about other Gusties. How do I talk to Geek Bot?Talk to the bot like you’d talk to a coworker: Don’t just type a keyword. Instead, ask a question, or tell the bot what you want to do. For example, don’t type “Zscaler,” type a sentence like, “How do I connect to Zscaler?” This gives the bot the context to know what kind of problem you’re having, or if you just want information. Why does Geek Bot expect you to make requests in this way? Geek Bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), which means it’s trained on the way people naturally ask questions and describe their problems, so the best way to communicate is using natural language that would also be understood by a human agent.Should I DM Geek Bot when I have a question?Yes you can DM Geek Bot for any question or issue you have. If Geekbot can’t help it will direct you to file an IT ticket. Geekbot is also in available in our #itops Slack channel and will respond if it thinks it can help.Is Geek Bot replacing IT Support or #itops?No! Imagine Geek Bot as an additional member of our IT Support team that is available 24/7 with IT knowledge and troubleshooting skills. The IT Support humans are still available to help you just like before in #itops or by filing a ticket in Jira via go/help or by filing a ticket directly with Geek Bot.When will Geek Bot reach out to me?Geek Bot watches tickets and contacts users when important changes happen on the ticket. Below, we list the changes to a ticket that cause Geek Bot to send a message to the user.Triggering Event on a Ticket. Ticket state changed to On Hold, awaiting requester's input. An IT Agent, a Watcher, or any other person adds a user facing comment. Ticket state changed to RESOLVED or CLOSED Ticket state is New or In Progress and has no comments for 4 days (the duration is configurable)A user added a comment and hasn't posted or canceled that comment within 90 seconds. How does Geek Bot handle software approvals?Geek Bot is programmed to know who the approvers are for most Okta apps. Geek Bot will send a Slack message to the assigned approver requesting approval. Once approved Geek Bot will instantly give you access to the app. Take a look below at all the apps Geek Bot can provide access to.Applications that Geek. Bot can provide access to15Five.

Here are a few common steps you can try on your own to resolve some of these issues.Restart your Computer: You might hear this tip a lot from IT. However, restarting the computer has helped IT resolved hundreds of mysterious problems! NVRAM/PRAM reset: This is one of the most common things IT will recommend you try when troubleshooting generic computer issues. PRAM resets solve a wide variety of problems, both hardware and software related. If you are having strange issues with your computer and you're not sure how to fix them, go ahead and try a PRAM reset. It can't hurt, and it's likely one of the first things IT will suggest you try.To perform a PRAM reset: Shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart.Force Quit: Sometimes an application will get stuck and you may not be able to quit. When this happens, there is a way to try and force quit the application without having to restart your computer. To force quit an application: Click the Apple icon in your menu bar, then click the Force Quit... button.Activity Monitor: This is a very useful tool for getting a sense of what processes are running on your machine (and potentially eating up a lot of resources). You'll notice several tabs at the top of Activity Monitor - in most cases the CPU, Memory, and Energy tabs will be the most helpful in determining what applications are driving your computer. If your fan is working really hard and you are not sure why, take a look at those tabs - the % CPU column in the CPU tab is a good place to start.To use Activity Monitor: Simply hit command + Space to bring up Spotlight search, and then type in Activity Monitor and launch the app. Need extra guidance?
