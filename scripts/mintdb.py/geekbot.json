It is trained on the Gusto environment and equipped with knowledge from the IT Confluence knowledge base to assist you with any asks or questions. Geek Bot integrates with Jira to create tickets, locate forms, and search the confluence knowledge base for you.What can Geek Bot help me with?Today Geekbot can help you with:Answer your troubleshooting and \u201cHow To\u201d questions. Filing tickets. Getting meaningful updates on tickets. Get access to Okta applications. Helping application owners approve or deny Gustie access to apps. Create Google Groups (currently limited to gusto.com groups)Add you and your teammates to Google Groups (currently limited to gusto.com groups)Looking up information about other Gusties. How do I talk to Geek Bot?Talk to the bot like you\u2019d talk to a coworker: Don\u2019t just type a keyword. Instead, ask a question, or tell the bot what you want to do. For example, don\u2019t type \u201cZscaler,\u201d type a sentence like, \u201cHow do I connect to Zscaler?\u201d This gives the bot the context to know what kind of problem you\u2019re having, or if you just want information. Why does Geek Bot expect you to make requests in this way? Geek Bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), which means it\u2019s trained on the way people naturally ask questions and describe their problems, so the best way to communicate is using natural language that would also be understood by a human agent.Should I DM Geek Bot when I have a question?Yes you can DM Geek Bot for any question or issue you have. If Geekbot can\u2019t help it will direct you to file an IT ticket. Geekbot is also in available in our #itops Slack channel and will respond if it thinks it can help.Is Geek Bot replacing IT Support or #itops?No! Imagine Geek Bot as an additional member of our IT Support team that is available 24/7 with IT knowledge and troubleshooting skills. The IT Support humans are still available to help you just like before in #itops or by filing a ticket in Jira via go/help or by filing a ticket directly with Geek Bot.When will Geek Bot reach out to me?Geek Bot watches tickets and contacts users when important changes happen on the ticket. Below, we list the changes to a ticket that cause Geek Bot to send a message to the user.Triggering Event on a Ticket. Ticket state changed to On Hold, awaiting requester's input. An IT Agent, a Watcher, or any other person adds a user facing comment. Ticket state changed to RESOLVED or CLOSED\u00a0Ticket state is New or In Progress and has no comments for 4 days (the duration is configurable)A user added a comment and hasn't posted or canceled that comment within 90 seconds. How does Geek Bot handle software approvals?Geek Bot is programmed to know who the approvers are for most Okta apps. Geek Bot will send a Slack message to the assigned approver requesting approval.
